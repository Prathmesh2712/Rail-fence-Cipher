# Rail-fence-Cipher
Project Description: Rail Fence Cipher Encryption and Decryption in C++

Introduction:
The Rail Fence Cipher is a simple transposition cipher that rearranges the letters of a message to encrypt or decrypt it. This project involves implementing the Rail Fence Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms in C++. The encryption algorithm will rearrange the letters of a given message using a specific pattern, while the decryption algorithm will reverse the process to recover the original message.

Project Steps:

1. User Input:
   - Prompt the user to enter a message to be encrypted or decrypted.
   - Ensure that the input message consists of only alphabetical characters and does not contain any special characters or numbers.

2. Encryption Algorithm:
   - Implement the Rail Fence Cipher encryption algorithm.
   - Set up the rail fence pattern by creating a matrix or an array to represent the rails.
   - Iterate through the characters of the message, placing them in the appropriate positions on the rails.
   - Concatenate the characters row by row to obtain the encrypted message.

3. Decryption Algorithm:
   - Implement the Rail Fence Cipher decryption algorithm.
   - Determine the pattern of the rail fence by calculating the number of rails and the number of characters per rail.
   - Iterate through the characters of the encrypted message, placing them back into the appropriate positions based on the rail fence pattern.
   - Concatenate the characters column by column to obtain the decrypted message.

4. Output:
   - Display the encrypted or decrypted message to the user.

5. Error Handling:
   - Handle any invalid input, such as empty messages or messages with non-alphabetical characters.
   - Provide appropriate error messages to guide the user.

6. Testing:
   - Test the encryption and decryption algorithms with various input messages to ensure correct results.
   - Verify that the decrypted message matches the original message.

7. User Interface (Optional):
   - Create a user-friendly interface that prompts the user for input and displays the encrypted or decrypted message.
   - Use appropriate formatting and messaging to guide the user through the process.

8. GitHub Repository:
   - Create a GitHub repository to host your Rail Fence Cipher project.
   - Include all the necessary source code files, such as the main program file and any additional files.
   - Write a README.md file that provides instructions on how to compile and run the program.
   - Add a license file, such as the MIT License, to specify the terms of use for your project.

Conclusion:
By implementing the Rail Fence Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms in C++, you will gain experience in string manipulation, algorithm implementation, and error handling. This project allows you to understand the principles of transposition ciphers and their practical applications. Hosting your project on GitHub demonstrates your ability to use version control and share your work with others.
